Timer()
=> Time (default 1mn?)
=> Play(callback)
=> Reset()

Better Naming for position
=> Position => enum (top/middle/left/bottom etc...)
=> Index1D => position of the 1D of the board => 0 - 80
=> Index2D => position of the 2D of the board [0, 0] => [8, 8]
=> BoardState should be TileState
=> getNectMove.ts => getActiveSection.ts

move boardSections.ts | utils => assets

CheckIfWon should return [Player1 | Player2, WiningLine] | [Empty, null]
